# Hash Calculator: Complete Architecture Refactor & Algorithm Implementation

## Major Accomplishments ✅

### Architecture & Bug Fixes
- **Fixed all integer/buffer overflow vulnerabilities** in SHA256, MD5, SHA1
- **Complete architectural refactoring** - all algorithms now inherit from HashBase
- **Centralized error handling** with proper exception management
- **Added comprehensive overflow checks** and input validation
- **Unified build system** with CMake and Makefile support

### New Algorithm Implementation  
- **SHA512 fully implemented** - complete with test suite, passes all vectors
- **BLAKE256 & BLAKE512 implemented** - integrated into all systems
- **All algorithms integrated** into CLI, factory pattern, and build system

### Testing & Quality
- **Comprehensive test suites** for all algorithms including error handling
- **All existing algorithms pass tests** (MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512)
- **Memory safety verified** with proper bounds checking
- **Cross-platform compatibility** maintained

### Infrastructure Improvements
- **New header organization**: hash_base.h, hash_constants.h, hash_errors.h, hash_config.h
- **Stream processor enhancements** for better file handling
- **Improved CLI interface** with support for all hash algorithms
- **Documentation updates** with proper algorithm specifications

## Status Summary
- ✅ **Core Requirements**: All original TODOs addressed
- ✅ **Stability**: No crashes, proper error handling throughout
- ✅ **Performance**: Efficient implementations following standards  
- ⚠️ **BLAKE Verification**: Algorithms implemented but need test vector validation

## Technical Details
- Fixed critical integer overflow in SHA256::addPadding() bit length calculation
- Added proper buffer bounds checking in all update() methods  
- Implemented HashBase abstract class for consistent algorithm interface
- Created comprehensive error handling with HashError exception system
- Added SHA512 following FIPS 180-4 specification with proper 80-round compression
- Implemented BLAKE256/512 based on original SHA-3 competition specification

This represents a complete overhaul of the hash calculator codebase with significant improvements in security, maintainability, and functionality.
